# Focus Session Analyzer

The **Focus Session Analyzer** is a React-based web application designed to track and analyze a user's focus while watching a YouTube video. Using **MediaPipe FaceMesh**, the app detects user gaze to determine focus levels and provides real-time visualizations along with a detailed session summary.

## Features
1. **Real-Time Gaze Detection**:
   - Tracks user gaze and determines if they are focused on the screen.
   - Automatically pauses or resumes the video in "Pause Mode" based on user focus.

2. **Session Analysis**:
   - Collects data on focus intervals and generates a detailed analysis.
   - Summarizes total focused and unfocused times with focus percentages.

3. **Interactive Graphs**:
   - Displays focus over time as a bar chart.
   - Highlights session intervals with focus and unfocus percentages.

4. **Customizable Modes**:
   - **Pause Mode**: Automatically controls video playback based on focus.
   - **Analyze Mode**: Tracks data without affecting video playback.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Simple UI for starting and controlling sessions.
   - Responsive charts and session summaries.
